            </p>

            <p>
              Oluwatoyin as an enigmatic, pragmatic and proactive professional,
              after her employment into ABUAD, literally created a robust
              pharmaceutical care operational system from scratch to an enviable

              Multisystem hospital.

            <p>
              With her robust background experience in pharmaceutical sales and
              marketing, Oluwatoyin Afolabi was able to coordinate an effective
              paperless online sales platform for the pharmacy operational
              system in the AMSH, a unique feat in modern day commerce achieved
              with active collaboration of the ICT department.
            </p>

            <p>
              Oluwatoyin's strive for excellence and proactive ness led to the
              establishment of a robust hospital production line for ABUAD
              brands of Methylated spirit, antiseptics/ disinfectant AFLON,
              Liquid soap, household bleach ABUADIK etc.
            </p>

            <p>
              Worthy of note and attention is Oluwatoyin 's quintessential move
              during the COVID 19 rage, when she led a team of vibrant
              pharmacists to successfully produce NAFDAC registered hand

            <p>
              To accomplish all of the above, educationally, Oluwatoyin first
              bagged a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree from OAU, IFE, an MSc in
              Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacy administration from University of
